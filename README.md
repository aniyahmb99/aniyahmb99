- 👋 Hi, I’m @aniyahmb99
- 👀 I’m interested in web develoment projects focusing and using Frontend technologies and UX/UI design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Frontend JavaScript libraries such as React, Angular, jQuery and Typescript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that use these technologies or just to create a large and complex project to challenge and put to use what I've learned this year.
- 📫 How to reach me ... contact me through my email at aniyah_mb@yahoo.com !
